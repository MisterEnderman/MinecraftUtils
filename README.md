Utility Plugin for creating Minecraft plugins for 1.16.5

This plugin is especially made to help others make minecraft plugins (1.16.5 only), this plugin is currently in beta so expect bugs.

If you find any issue report it as a GitHub Issue.

I don't have a maven repository for this project <em>yet</em>, I'll try to get one set up probably in the future.

This project took inspiration from JordanOsterberg.
