Utility Plugin for creating Minecraft plugins for 1.16.5

This plugin is especially made to help others make minecraft plugins (1.16.5 only)

If you find any issue report it as a GitHub Issue.

I don't have a maven repository for this yet, I'll try to :)

This project took inspiration from JordanOsterberg.
